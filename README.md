# Load jQuery in compatibility mode. 

[Use `jQuery.noConflict()`](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/) to
load a clean version of jQuery, avoiding collisions with other JS
libraries that are installed on the page.

Intended for use in hostile environments where another JS library has
previously been loaded.
